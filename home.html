				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm a nerd and an explorer; my main passions in life have been numbers and the outdoors. I've been fortunate enough to have had my work take me from Orthopaedics research in China, to tree planting in northern BC. But if I were to be honest, my dream job would be studying math in the forest &mdash; alas, I have yet to find means to make a living doing this.</p>

				<p>I aspire to live an active lifestyle; my spare time is typically filled with activities such as rock climbing, running, and swimming. I believe that the best way to spend one's time is outdoors, and I enjoy backpacking and camping whenever I have the opportunity.</p>

							<h3>Details</h3>
							<p>While at DBRS my time was divided between two roles. Half my time was spent designing a variety of marketing materials for print and web campaigns, the remainder was spent working closely with the Senior Market Analyst to create forecasting models.</p>

							<p>During my term at DBRS I took the initiative to redesign the business development newsletter template. This resulted in subsequent publications being released more efficiently and improved the overall visual appeal.</p>

							<p>One of my proudest achievements was when I was able to significantly reduce the time required to uploading web analytics to our database by familiarizing myself with VBA and writing an Excel macro to format the data automatically.</p>

							<h3>Details</h3>
							<p>Working at the Orthopaedic Institute was an incredible experience that challenged both my communication skills and my independent work ethic. I worked with one other team member to pilot a 3-D printed back brace for children with idiopathic scoliosis.</p>
							<p>Our research included identifying gaps in current bracing technology, creatively using 3-D printing to find a solution, and working closely with the children's hospital to develop a prototype.</p>
